Dear Dr. Markel,

Thank you for reviewing our manuscript "Ten Simple Rules for Digital
Data Storage" and considering our resubmission. We have thoroughly considered the reviewer responses and taken almost all of their suggestions into account in our revived manuscript.  We believe this has made our submission even stronger.  Thank you again for your time in helping us improve our manuscript.

Sincerely,

Dr. Edmund Hart
